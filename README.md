After the Independence of India in 1947, the state of Punjab was also divided in two parts. Its state capital, Lahore, became a part of Pakistan, and Punjab was left without a capital. Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India with Punjab State Government approached the french architect, Le Corbusier to design and plan the new city of Chandigarh, to be a milestone to modern independent Indian city and its architecture.  The city was planned keeping in mind the concept of ‘Garden City’ in mind, and the whole city was divided into smaller sectors, each having all the essential amenities and infrastructure for people living in those sectors. The city and its modernist architecture, inspired heavily from ‘Bauhaus’, in itself is a masterpiece both in terms of city planning and architectural design.  Being the first planned Indian city, Chandigarh left an impression on the overall architectural movement of newly independent India. It is a debate whether the impact and the paradigm shift that the city of Chandigarh had was a positive change or something that did not consider the wants and needs of Indian population dwelling in these cities.  This is a story of Chandigarh, from its inception, to the process of its planning, and its impact on the people.
